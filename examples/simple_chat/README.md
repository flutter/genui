# Simple Chat Example

This application is a minimal example of how to use the `flutter_genui` package to create a simple, conversational chat application.

## Purpose

The main goal of this example is to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of `flutter_genui` in a straightforward chat context. It shows how to:

1. Initialize and use the `GenUiConversation`, the primary facade for the package.
2. Provide a simple system prompt to guide the AI's behavior.
3. Send user messages to the AI and receive responses.
4. Handle the creation of new UI "surfaces" generated by the AI.
5. Render these dynamic UI surfaces within a standard chat message list.
6. Manage a conversation history that interleaves user text messages with AI-generated UI responses.
7. Support multiple AI backends (Firebase AI or Google Generative AI).

Unlike more complex examples, this app does not define a custom widget catalog. Instead, it relies on the default `coreCatalog` provided by `flutter_genui`, meaning the AI can only respond with basic widgets like `Text`, `Column`, `ElevatedButton`, etc.

## How it Works

The application's logic is contained almost entirely within `lib/main.dart`.

1. **Initialization**: A `GenUiConversation` is created with a simple system prompt instructing it to act as a helpful assistant. It's configured with an `onSurfaceAdded` callback.
2. **User Input**: The user types a message into a `TextField` and hits send.
3. **Sending the Message**:
   - The user's text is immediately added to the local message list and displayed on screen as a simple text message (e.g., "You: Hello").
   - The `genUiConversation.sendRequest()` method is called with the user's text wrapped in a `UserMessage`.
4. **AI Response**:
   - The `GenUiConversation` sends the conversation history to the configured `ContentGenerator` (either `FirebaseAiContentGenerator` or `GoogleGenerativeAiContentGenerator`).
   - The AI model processes the prompt and generates `A2uiMessage`s (like `SurfaceUpdate`, `BeginRendering`).
   - These messages are emitted on the `ContentGenerator.a2uiMessageStream`.
5. **UI Rendering**:
   - `GenUiConversation` listens to the stream and processes the `A2uiMessage`s, invoking the appropriate callbacks like `onSurfaceAdded`.
   - The `_handleSurfaceAdded` callback adds a new message item to the list, containing the `surfaceId`.
   - The `ListView` rebuilds, and a `GenUiSurface` widget is rendered for the AI's message, dynamically building the UI based on the `UiDefinition` managed by `GenUiManager`.

## Getting Started

This example supports two AI backends: **Google Generative AI** (default) and **Firebase AI**. Choose the option that best fits your needs.

### Option 1: Using Google Generative AI (Default)

1. **Get an API Key**: Obtain a Google Cloud API key with access to the Generative Language API from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

2. **Configure the API Key**: In `lib/main.dart`, replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:

   ```dart
   const String googleApiKey = 'your_actual_api_key_here';
   ```

3. **Run the App**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Option 2: Using Firebase AI

1. **Configure Firebase**: Follow the instructions in the main `flutter_genui` [USAGE.md](../../packages/flutter_genui/USAGE.md) to add Firebase to your Flutter app. You will need to:
   - Set up a Firebase project
   - Generate a `firebase_options.dart` file using the FlutterFire CLI
   - Update `lib/main.dart` to import `firebase_options.dart` instead of `firebase_options_stub.dart`

2. **Switch the Backend**: In `lib/main.dart`, change the `defaultBackend` constant:

   ```dart
   const AiBackend defaultBackend = AiBackend.firebase;
   ```

3. **Run the App**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Switching Between Backends

To switch backends, modify the `defaultBackend` constant in `lib/main.dart`:
- `AiBackend.google` (default) - Uses Google Generative AI with an API key
- `AiBackend.firebase` - Uses Firebase AI
