# Flutter Generative UI SDK (Flutter GenUI, flutter_genui)

A Flutter library to enable developers to easily add interactive
generative UI to their applications.

## Status: Highly Experimental

This is an experimental package, which means the API will change (sometimes drastically)
or this package might be abandoned. Feedback very welcome!

## TL;DR

GenUI SDK for Flutter lets you replace static "walls of text" from your LLM with dynamic, interactive
graphical UI.
It uses a JSON-based format to compose UIs from your existing widget catalog, turning conversations or agent
interactions into rich, intuitive experiences. State changes in the UI are fed back to the agent, creating a
powerful, high-bandwidth interaction loop. The GenUI SDK for Flutter is easy to integrate into your Flutter
application to significantly improve the usability and satisfaction of your Chatbots and next-generation
agent-based user experiences.

## Goals

* Increase Interaction Bandwidth for Users: Allow users to interact with data and controls directly,
  making task completion faster and more intuitive. Move beyond a "wall of text".
* Simple and easy to use by developers: Seamlessly integrate with your existing Flutter workflow,
  design systems, and widget catalogs.
* Drive agent-human UX forward: Innovate ways to dramatically improve how users interact with their
  LLMs and Agents. Radically simplifying the process of building UI-based agent interactions, by
  eliminating custom middleware between the agent and the UI layer.

## Use cases

* Incorporate Graphical UI into Chat Bots: Instead of describing a list of products in text,
  the LLM can render an interactive carousel of product widgets. Instead of asking for a user to
  type out answers to questions, the LLM can render sliders, checkboxes, and more.
* Create Dynamically Composed UIs: An agent can generate a complete form with sliders, date pickers,
  and text fields on the fly based on a user's request to "book a flight."

## Quick sample

### Using GenUI SDK with Firebase AI Logic

```
// initializing the library
GenUiManager(catalog: catalog);

// connecting to your LLM library
AiClient(
      systemInstruction:
          '''You are a helpful assistant who speaks in the style of a pirate.
    
           The user will ask questions, and you will respond by generating appropriate
           UI elements. Typically, you will first elicit more information to
           understand the user's needs, then you will start displaying information
           and the user's plans.''',
      modelCreator:
          ({required configuration, systemInstruction, toolConfig, tools}) =>
              FirebaseAI.googleAI().generativeModel(
                model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
                configuration: configuration,
                systemInstruction: systemInstruction,
                tools: tools,
              ),
    ),

// adding your widgets into the catalog

// append to your system prompt

// get UI in response to an inference

// render that UI

// profit!
```

## Key Features & Benefits

* **Integrates with your LLM:** Works with your chosen LLM and backend to incorporate graphical
  UI responses alongside traditional text.  
* **Leverages Your Widget Catalog:** Renders UI using your existing, beautifully crafted widgets
  for brand and design consistency.  
* **Interactive State Feedback:** Widget state changes are sent back to the LLM, enabling a
  true interactive loop where the UI influences the agent's next steps.  
* **Firebase AI Logic & Genkit Ready:** Designed to work seamlessly with Firebase AI Logic and the
  Genkit framework.  
* **Framework Agnostic:** Can be integrated into your agent library or LLM framework of choice.  
* **JSON Based:** Uses a simple, open standard for UI definitionâ€”no proprietary formats.  
* **Cross-Platform Flutter:** Works anywhere Flutter works (mobile, iOS, Android, Web, and more).  
* **Widget Composition:** Supports nested layouts and composition of widgets for complex UIs.  
* **Basic Layout:** LLM-driven basic layout generation.  
* **Open Source:** Full transparency and community-driven improvement.  
* **Any Model:** Can be integrated with any LLM that can generate structured JSON output.

## Roadmap

* **Genkit Integration:** Integration with Genkit (Target: Sept 2025).  
* **Expanded LLM Framework Support:** Official support for additional LLM frameworks.  
* **Streaming UI:** Support for progressively rendering UI components as they stream from the LLM.  
* **Full-Screen Composition:** Enable LLM-driven composition and navigation of entire app screens.  
* **A2A Agent Support:** Support for A2A agent interactions.  
* **Dart Bytecode:** Future support for Dart Bytecode for even greater dynamism and flexibility.
