# Flutter Generative UI SDK (Flutter GenUI, flutter_genui)

A Flutter library to enable developers to easily add interactive
generative UI to their applications.

## Status: Highly Experimental

This is a highly experimental package, which means the API will change (sometimes drastically).
[Feedback is very welcome](https://github.com/flutter/genui/issues/new/choose).

## TL;DR

Our goal for the GenUI SDK for Flutter is to help you replace static "walls of text" from your LLM with
dynamic, interactive, graphical UI.
It uses a JSON-based format to compose UIs from your existing widget catalog, turning conversations or agent
interactions into rich, intuitive experiences. State changes in the UI are fed back to the agent, creating a
powerful, high-bandwidth interaction loop. The GenUI SDK for Flutter aims to be easy to integrate into your Flutter
application to significantly improve the usability and satisfaction of your chatbots and next-generation
agent-based user experiences.

## High-level goals

* Increase Interaction Bandwidth for Users: allow users to interact with data and controls directly,
  making task completion faster and more intuitive. Move beyond a "wall of text".
* Simple and easy to use by developers: seamlessly integrate with your existing Flutter workflow,
  design systems, and widget catalogs.
* Drive agent-human UX forward: innovate ways to dramatically improve how users interact with their
  LLMs and Agents. Radically simplify the process of building UI-based agent interactions, by
  eliminating custom middleware between the agent and the UI layer.

## Use cases

* Incorporate graphical UI into chatbots: instead of describing a list of products in text,
  the LLM can render an interactive carousel of product widgets. Instead of asking for a user to
  type out answers to questions, the LLM can render sliders, checkboxes, and more.
* Create dynamically composed UIs: an agent can generate a complete form with sliders, date pickers,
  and text fields on the fly based on a user's request to "book a flight."

## Example

### Using the GenUI SDK with Firebase AI Logic

```
// Adding your widgets into the catalog.
final catalog = Catalog([
  ...coreCatalog.items,
  myCustomNewWidget,
]);

/// Initializing the library.
late final _uiAgent = UiAgent(
  '''
  You are a bicycle maintenance assistant who is an expert in diagnosing issues and
  giving step-by-step instructions.
  ''',
  catalog: catalog,
  onSurfaceAdded: _onSurfaceAdded,
  // ignore: avoid_print
  onWarning: (value) => print('Warning from UiAgent: $value'),
);

// Put the surface, added by AI, to the list of messages that should be rendered,
// trigger re-render, and scroll to bottom.
void _onSurfaceAdded(SurfaceAdded surface) {
  if (!mounted) return;
  setState(() {
    _messages.add(MessageController(surfaceId: surface.surfaceId));
  });
  _scrollToBottom();
}

// Render that UI.
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   if (type == MessageType.genUi) {
     return GenUiSurface(
       host: _uiAgent.host,
       surfaceId: _surfaceId,
       onEvent: _handleEvent,
     );
   }
}
```

## Implementation goals

* **Integrate with your LLM:** Work with your chosen LLM and backend to incorporate graphical
  UI responses alongside traditional text.  
* **Leverage Your Widget Catalog:** Render UI using your existing, beautifully crafted widgets
  for brand and design consistency.  
* **Interactive State Feedback:** Widget state changes are sent back to the LLM, enabling a
  true interactive loop where the UI influences the agent's next steps.  
* **Framework Agnostic:** Be integrated into your agent library or LLM framework of choice.  
* **JSON Based:** Use a simple, open standard for UI definitionâ€”no proprietary formats.  
* **Cross-Platform Flutter:** Work anywhere Flutter works (mobile, iOS, Android, Web, and more).  
* **Widget Composition:** Support nested layouts and composition of widgets for complex UIs.  
* **Basic Layout:** LLM-driven basic layout generation.  
* **Any Model:** Integrate with any LLM that can generate structured JSON output.

## Some things we're thinking about

* ** Genkit Integration:** Integration with Genkit.
* ** Expanded LLM Framework Support:** Official support for additional LLM frameworks.
* ** Streaming UI:** Support for progressively rendering UI components as they stream from the LLM.
* ** Full-Screen Composition:** Enable LLM-driven composition and navigation of entire app screens.
* ** A2A Agent Support:** Support for A2A agent interactions.
* ** Dart Bytecode:** Future support for Dart Bytecode for even greater dynamism and flexibility.
