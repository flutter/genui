We have ported the @packages/spikes/a2a-python library to Dart.  The a2a spec is in @a2a.md and I'd like you to keep some guidelines in mind for creating Dart code in @flutter.md and @create-package.md Please make sure that all functionality for all of the capabilities described by the A2A specification is provided, using the implementation in the python version as a guide for the specific details of implementation. There is a comprehensive and detailed design document in a2a_dart/DESIGN.md

There are some things that aren't done, though: the integration test has been disabled, there are TODOs in the code, and the SSE transport is not implemented.
Please finish the integration test, implement the SSE transport, and address all TODOs.
