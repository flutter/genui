# GenUI Spikes

_`spike`_ - An experiment or proof of concept (in [Scrum](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>) terminology).

> These are even _more_ experimental experiments having to do with GenUI that we're playing with. They could be **deleted** or completely refactored/renamed/broken at any moment, so **don't rely on them**.
