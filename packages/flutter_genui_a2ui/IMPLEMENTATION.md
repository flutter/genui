# Implementation Plan: `flutter_genui_a2ui`

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for creating the `flutter_genui_a2ui` package.

## Journal

This section will be updated after each phase to log actions taken, things learned, surprises, and any deviations from the plan. It will be maintained in chronological order.

### Phase 1 Completion (October 21, 2025)

- Created the new Flutter package in `/Users/gspencer/code/genui/packages/flutter_genui_a2ui`.
- Removed boilerplate `lib/main.dart` and `test/` directory.
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` with correct description, dependencies (`a2a`, `flutter_genui`, `logging`, `uuid`), and dev dependencies (`dart_flutter_team_lints`, `flutter_test`). Set version to `0.1.0`.
- Created `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `LICENSE` files.
- Copied `analysis_options.yaml`.
- Ran `dart fix --apply`, `dart analyze`, and `dart format .` to ensure code quality.
- Committed the initial empty version of the package.

### Phase 2 Completion (October 21, 2025)

- Created `lib/src/a2ui_agent_connector.dart` and adapted `A2uiAgentConnector` and `AgentCard` classes from the `a2ui_client` spike.
- Created `lib/src/a2ui_ai_client.dart` to implement the `AiClient` interface from `flutter_genui`.
  - Implemented the constructor and internal state as described in `DESIGN.md`.
  - Implemented the `getAgentCard` method.
  - Implemented the `generateContent` and `generateText` methods to send user messages to the A2A server.
  - Implemented the internal `_processA2aStream` method to handle incoming A2A stream events and forward A2UI messages to the `GenUiManager`.
  - Implemented the `_handleUiEvent` method to send user interactions back to the A2A server.
- Created `lib/flutter_genui_a2ui.dart` to export the public API of the package.
- Fixed `Logger` name collision in `lib/src/a2ui_ai_client.dart` by hiding `Logger` from `package:a2a/a2a.dart`.
- Modified `A2uiAgentConnector` and `A2uiAiClient` constructors to accept an optional `A2AClient` for testing.
- Updated `test/a2ui_client_test.dart` to inject `FakeA2AClient` via constructors and set `taskId` for relevant tests.
- Ran `dart fix --apply`, `dart analyze`, and `dart format .` to ensure code quality.
- All tests passed.

### Phase 3 Completion (October 21, 2025)

- Created a new Flutter application in the `example/` directory.
- Added a dependency on `flutter_genui_a2ui` using a path reference.
- Implemented the chat conversation view, including a `ListView` for messages and a `TextField` for user input.
- Implemented a fixed `GenUiSurface` to render the A2UI-generated UI.
- Initialized the `A2uiAiClient` and `UiAgent` and connected them to the UI.
- Ran `dart fix --apply`, `dart analyze`, and `dart format .` to ensure code quality.

### Phase 4 Completion (October 21, 2025)

- Created a comprehensive `README.md` file for the `flutter_genui_a2ui` package.
- Created a `GEMINI.md` file in the package directory that describes the package, its purpose, and implementation details of the package and the layout of the files.
- Ran `dart fix --apply`, `dart analyze`, and `dart format .` to ensure code quality.
