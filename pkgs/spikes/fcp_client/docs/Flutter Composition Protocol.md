# **Flutter Composition Protocol**

A Specification for a Non-Recursive, JSON-Driven UI Framework for Flutter

## **Section 1: Foundational Architecture and Data Flow**

This document specifies the architecture and data formats for "Flutter Composition Protocol" (FCP), a framework for rendering Flutter user interfaces from a JSON definition. The design is guided by principles of strict separation of concerns, versioning, and targeted updates, with schemas constrained for compatibility with structured data generation models. It draws inspiration from existing solutions like Remote Flutter Widgets (RFW) while introducing a more formalized, contract-driven approach to enhance stability and predictability.

### **1.1. Core Philosophy: Decoupling and Contracts**

The central philosophy of FCP is the strict decoupling of four key elements, which together define the complete user interface:

1. **The Catalog (The Contract):** A client-defined document that specifies precisely which widgets, properties, events, and data structures the application is capable of handling. This is a static contract that governs all communication.
2. **The Layout (The Structure):** A server-provided JSON structure that describes the arrangement of widgets, their static properties, and their relationships to one another.
3. **The State (The Data):** A server-provided JSON object containing the dynamic values that populate the layout, such as text content, boolean flags, or lists of data.
4. **The Data Model (The Schemas):** A set of formal definitions for complex data objects used within the state, included within the Catalog to ensure type safety.

### **1.2. The DynamicUIPacket: The Atomic Unit of Communication**

All initial UI descriptions transmitted from the server to the client are encapsulated within a single, top-level JSON object: the `DynamicUIPacket`. This packet represents an atomic and self-contained description of a UI view at a specific moment.

The packet contains the following top-level keys:

- `formatVersion`: A semantic version string (e.g., "2.0.0") for the FCP specification itself.
- `layout`: The complete, non-recursive widget tree definition, as detailed in Section 3.
- `state`: The initial state data for the widgets defined in the layout, as detailed in Section 4.
- `metadata`: An optional object for server-side information.

### **1.3. Data Flow Model**

The data flow is a well-defined sequence:

1. **Client Initialization:** The Flutter app loads its `WidgetCatalog`.
2. **Initial UI Request:** The client requests the initial UI from the server, including sending the `WidgetCatalog` to the server.
3. **Server Response:** The server responds with a `DynamicUIPacket`.
4. **Client-Side Rendering:** The client validates the packet against its catalog, then builds the Flutter widget tree by processing the layout and applying state bindings.
5. **User Interaction:** A user interacts with a widget (e.g., taps a button).
6. **Event Transmission:** The client constructs and sends a lightweight `EventPayload` to the server.
7. **Server-Side Logic & Targeted Update:** The server processes the event and responds with a delta-only payloadâ€”either a `LayoutUpdate` to change the structure or a `StateUpdate` to change data.
8. **Client-Side Patching:** The client applies the update, triggering targeted rebuilds of only the affected widgets.

        Flutter Client-->>-User: Displays Updated UI
    end
```

Architectural Note:

The sequence above shows a "Handshake Model" where the client sends its catalog on the first connection.

- PROS: Simplifies the deployment process; no separate step is needed to publish the catalog.
- CONS: Increases initial connection latency as the catalog is sent over the network.

An alternative is the "Out-of-Band Model" where catalogs are published to a central repository during the app's build process, and the server fetches them from there.

- PROS: Keeps the initial client connection very lightweight and fast.
- CONS: Adds a step to the CI/CD pipeline and couples it to the server's infrastructure.

## **Section 2: The Widget Catalog: Defining Capabilities and Data Models**

The `WidgetCatalog` is a JSON document, bundled within the client application, that serves as a strict contract of the client's rendering and data-handling capabilities.

### **2.1. Purpose: The Client-Server Contract**

The catalog explicitly declares the client's capabilities, enabling:

- **Server-Side Validation:** The server can validate any `DynamicUIPacket` against the client's catalog before sending it.
- **Versioning and Coexistence:** The server can store multiple catalog versions and generate compatible UI for different client versions.
- **Guided LLM Generation:** The catalog provides a structured schema that can be used to constrain the output of a Large Language Model, ensuring it only generates valid, renderable UI definitions.
- **Formalized Data Structures:** It allows for defining complex data types, ensuring that `state` objects are well-formed and type-safe.

### **2.2. Catalog Schema (`WidgetCatalog`)**

The catalog is a top-level JSON object:

- `catalogVersion`: A string representing the version of the catalog file itself (e.g., "2.1.0").
- `dataTypes`: An object where each key is a custom data type name (e.g., `User`), and the value is a JSON Schema definition for that type.
- `items`: An object where each key is a widget type name (e.g., `Container`), and the value is a `WidgetDefinition` object.

### **2.3. Custom Data Type Definitions (`dataTypes`)**

This section allows the client to declare reusable, complex data structures. This is crucial for domain modeling and ensuring that state updates are type-safe.

The value of each key under `dataTypes` **must** be a valid JSON Schema object.

```json
// Example: A dataTypes block defining User and Product models
"dataTypes": {
  "User": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": { "type": "string" },
      "displayName": { "type": "string" },
      "isPremium": { "type": "boolean", "default": false }
    },
    "required": ["id", "displayName"]
  },
  "Product": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "sku": { "type": "string" },
      "name": { "type": "string" },
      "price": { "type": "number" }
    },
    "required": ["sku", "name", "price"]
  }
}
```

### **2.4. Widget Definition Schema (`WidgetDefinition`)**

This object describes a single renderable widget type.

- `properties`: An object defining the supported attributes. Each key is a property name (e.g., `color`), and the value is a `PropertyDefinition` object.
- `events`: An object defining the events this widget can emit. Each key is an event name (e.g., `onPressed`), and the value is a JSON Schema defining the structure of the `arguments` object for that event.

### **2.5. Property Definition Schema (`PropertyDefinition`)**

This object specifies the type and constraints for a single widget property.

- `type`: A string defining the data type. The value must be one of the built-in FCP types or a key defined in the top-level `dataTypes` object.
  - **Primitives**: `"String"`, `"Number"`, `"Boolean"`.
  - **Reference Types**: `"WidgetId"`, `"ListOfWidgetIds"`.
  - **Enumerations**: `"Enum"` (requires a `values` array property).
  - **Built-in Complex Types**: `"Color"`, `"EdgeInsets"`, `"TextStyle"`, `"Alignment"`. These correspond to common Flutter data types and are pre-defined.
  - **Custom Data Types**: Any string that is a key in the `dataTypes` map (e.g., `"User"`, `"Product"` from the example above).
- `values`: An array of strings, required only when `type` is `"Enum"`.
- `isRequired`: A boolean indicating if the property is mandatory.
- `defaultValue`: An optional value to be used if an optional property is not provided.

## **Section 3: UI Composition: The Non-Recursive Layout Schema**

To meet the constraint of a non-recursive format, the FCP layout is defined using a flat adjacency list model.

### **3.1. The Adjacency List Model**

The layout is a flat list of `LayoutNode` objects. Parent-child relationships are established through ID references. This model allows for $O(1)$ amortized time lookup for any widget by its ID, which is critical for applying targeted updates efficiently.

### **3.2. Layout Schema (`Layout`)**

- `root`: A string containing the `id` of the root `LayoutNode`.
- `nodes`: An array of `LayoutNode` objects.

### **3.3. Layout Node Schema (`LayoutNode`)**

- `id`: A required, unique string that identifies this specific widget instance.
- `type`: A string that must match a widget type name in the `WidgetCatalog`.
- `properties`: An object containing static properties.
- `bindings`: An optional object that maps widget properties to the `state` object. See Section 4.2.
- `itemTemplate`: For list-building widgets, this is a complete `LayoutNode` object used as a template. See Section 3.4.

### **3.4. Advanced Composition: List Rendering with Builders**

To efficiently render dynamic lists (e.g., search results), the framework supports a builder pattern. This avoids defining a `LayoutNode` for every single item in a list.

A special widget type, e.g., `ListViewBuilder`, can be defined in the catalog. It uses a combination of data binding and a template to generate its children.

- **`properties`**: The builder widget itself would have standard properties (e.g., `scrollDirection`).

- **`bindings`**: It would have a binding to an array in the state object.

```json
"bindings": { "data": { "path": "products" } }
```

- **`itemTemplate`**: It contains a single `LayoutNode` definition that serves as a template for each item. This template can use special binding paths like `item.name` or `item.price`, which the client resolves for each element of the bound `data` list.

```json
// Example: A node for a ListViewBuilder
{
  "id": "product_list",
  "type": "ListViewBuilder",
  "properties": { "scrollDirection": "vertical" },
  "bindings": { "data": { "path": "products" } },
  "itemTemplate": {
    "id": "product_item_template",
    "type": "ListItem",
    "properties": {},
    "bindings": {
      "title": { "path": "item.name" },
      "subtitle": { "path": "item.price", "format": "${}" }
    }
  }
}
```

## **Section 4: Dynamic Data: The State Management Schema**

FCP enforces a clean separation between the UI's structure (layout) and its dynamic data (state).

### **4.1. The `state` Object: A Centralized Data Store**

The `state` key in the `DynamicUIPacket` holds a single JSON object. This is the sole source of truth for all dynamic data. By defining the structure of its contents in the catalog's `dataTypes` section, the state object is not an arbitrary blob but a well-defined, validatable data model. For example, the state could contain a `currentUser` object that is validated against the `User` schema from the catalog.

### **4.2. Data Binding with Transformations**

The `bindings` map within a `LayoutNode` forges the connection between layout and state. This mechanism is enhanced to support simple, client-side data transformations.

A binding value is an object that specifies the `path` to the data in the state and an optional transformation.

```json
// General structure of a binding object
"bindings": {
  "widgetProperty": {
    "path": "path.to.data.in.state",
    // Optional transformer below
    "format": "Value is: {}"
  }
}
```

**Supported Transformations:**

- **`format`**: A string with a `{}` placeholder, which will be replaced by the value from `path`.

  - Example: `{"path": "user.name", "format": "Welcome, {}!"}`

- **`condition`**: Evaluates a path to a boolean. Can be used to conditionally provide a value.

  - `if`: The value to use if the path is `true`.

  - `else`: The value to use if the path is `false`.

  - Example: `{"path": "user.isPremium", "if": "Premium User", "else": "Standard User"}`

- **`map`**: Maps a value to another value. Useful for enum-like state.

  - `mapping`: An object where keys are possible state values and values are the desired output.

  - `fallback`: A value to use if the state value is not in the map.

  - Example: `{"path": "status", "mapping": {"active": "#FF00FF00", "inactive": "#FFFF0000"}, "fallback": "#FF888888"}`

This small, predefined set of transformers adds significant declarative power without the security risks of a full expression language.

## **Section 5: Event Handling and Targeted Updates**

### **5.1. Client-to-Server: The `EventPayload`**

When a user triggers an event, the client sends an `EventPayload` to the server.

- `sourceNodeId`: The `id` of the `LayoutNode` that generated the event.

- `eventName`: The name of the event (e.g., `onPressed`).

- `arguments`: An optional object containing contextual data. The structure of this object **must** conform to the schema defined for this event in the `WidgetCatalog`.

### **5.2. Server-to-Client: The `StateUpdate` Payload**

To change only dynamic data, the server sends a `StateUpdate` payload using the **JSON Patch standard (RFC 6902\)**.

- `patches`: An array of JSON Patch operation objects. For example, to change a user's name to "Bob", the array would contain:

```json
[{ "op": "replace", "path": "/user/name", "value": "Bob" }]
```

### **5.3. Server-to-Client: The `LayoutUpdate` Payload**

For surgical modifications to the UI's structure, the server sends a `LayoutUpdate` payload with a simpler, custom operation set.

- `operations`: An array of layout modification objects. Each object specifies an `op` (`add`, `remove`, `update`), the nodes to modify, and targeting information.

## **Section 6: Complete JSON Schema Definitions**

This section provides the formal, consolidated, and valid JSON Schema definitions for the FCP framework.

### **6.1. Communication Payloads Schema**

This schema defines the objects that are actively exchanged between the client and server.

```

## **Section 7: Client-Side Implementation and Best Practices**

### **7.1. The FCP Interpreter**

A robust client-side interpreter should be composed of several key components:

- **Parser and Validator:** Deserializes JSON and validates payloads against both the master schema and the client's `WidgetCatalog`. This includes validating parts of the `state` object against the schemas provided in `dataTypes`.
- **Widget Tree Builder:** Constructs the Flutter widget tree.
- **State Manager:** Holds the state object and notifies listening widgets to rebuild when a `StateUpdate` is applied.
- **Binding Processor:** A crucial component responsible for resolving binding paths and applying the declared transformations.
- **Update Applier:** Processes incoming `StateUpdate` and `LayoutUpdate` payloads.

### **7.2. Performance Considerations**

- **Granular Rebuilds:** A change to a single value in the state should only trigger a rebuild of the specific widgets bound to that value.

- **Efficient List Building:** Use Flutter's `ListView.builder` under the hood for FCP's `ListViewBuilder` to ensure that list items are only built as they are scrolled into view.

- **`const` Widgets:** Use `const` widgets in the client-side mapping code wherever possible.

### **7.3. Error Handling**

- **Invalid Payloads:** Handle malformed JSON or payloads that do not conform to the schema.

- **Catalog Violations:** If the server sends a layout that violates the `WidgetCatalog` (e.g., unknown widget, bad property type, malformed state object according to a `dataType` schema), the client should log the error and display a fallback UI, not crash.

- **Broken Bindings:** If a binding path is invalid or a transformation fails, the client should use a default value or display a visual error indicator.
