# `test_and_fix` Package

## Overview

The `test_and_fix` package is a command-line tool designed to automate the process of running tests, analysis, and code formatting across all Dart and Flutter projects within the `genui` monorepo. It replaces the functionality of the original `run_all_tests_and_fixes.sh` script with a more robust and platform-independent Dart solution.

## Implementation Details

The tool is architected with a separation of concerns: the command-line argument parsing and the core logic.

### Entry Point

The main executable script is located in `bin/test_and_fix.dart`. It is responsible for:

- Parsing command-line arguments:
  - `--help` (`-h`): Prints usage information.
  - `--verbose` (`-v`): Prints the full output for all jobs, including successful ones.
  - `--all`: Runs checks on all projects, including those that are normally skipped (e.g., `spikes`).
- Instantiating and running the `TestAndFix` class.
- Exiting with an appropriate exit code based on the success of the run.

### Core Logic

The core logic resides in the `TestAndFix` class in `lib/test_and_fix.dart`. It uses the `process_runner` package to execute multiple processes in parallel, significantly speeding up the testing and analysis workflow.

### Project Discovery

The tool begins by scanning the monorepo for projects. It identifies projects by searching for `pubspec.yaml` files. To avoid unnecessary processing, it excludes certain directories.

- **Always excluded:** `.dart_tool`, `ephemeral`, `firebase_core`, `build`.
- **Excluded by default (unless `--all` is passed):** `spikes`, `fix_copyright`, `test_and_fix`.

### Task Execution

Once the projects are identified, the tool creates a series of jobs to be executed in parallel using a `ProcessPool`. These jobs are categorized as follows:

- **Global Jobs:** These are tasks that run once for the entire repository:

  1.  `dart fix --apply .`
  2.  `dart format .` (depends on `dart fix`)
  3.  `dart run tool/fix_copyright/bin/fix_copyright.dart --force` (depends on `dart format`)

- **Project-Specific Jobs:** For each discovered project, the tool runs the following (depending on the global jobs):
  - `dart analyze`: Performs static analysis.
  - `dart test` or `flutter test`: If a `test` directory exists, it runs the appropriate test command. The tool checks the `pubspec.yaml` to determine if it's a Flutter project.

### Output Handling

After all jobs have completed, the tool intelligently separates the results into successful and failed jobs. It first prints a summary of successful jobs, followed by a clearly marked section with the detailed output of any failed jobs, making it easy to identify and address issues. If any job fails, the tool exits with a non-zero exit code, making it suitable for use in CI/CD pipelines.

## File Layout

- `bin/test_and_fix.dart`: The main executable script for the tool.
- `lib/test_and_fix.dart`: Contains the core `TestAndFix` class and its logic.
- `pubspec.yaml`: Defines the package's dependencies, including `process_runner` and `args`.
- `README.md`: Provides a user-friendly guide on how to use the tool.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests for the tool's logic, including project discovery and command execution.
