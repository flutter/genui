# `simple_chat` to `genui_client` Example: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to refactor the `simple_chat` example into a new example for the `genui_client` package.

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Project Scaffolding and Dependency Setup

- [ ] Create a new Flutter project in `packages/genui_client/example`.
- [ ] Remove the default `main.dart` and `test/` directory.
- [ ] Update `pubspec.yaml` to remove `flutter_lints` and add a path dependency on `genui_client` and a dependency on `logging`.
- [ ] Create a new `analysis_options.yaml` that includes `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` and ignores generated files.
- [ ] Create a `README.md` with initial setup instructions for the server and client.

**Post-Phase 1 Steps:**

- [ ] Run `dart_fix` and `dart_format` to clean up any generated Dart code.
- [ ] Run `analyze_files` and fix any reported issues.
- [ ] Run tests to ensure all pass (Note: there may be no tests in this phase).
- [ ] Run `dart_format` again to ensure correct formatting.
- [ ] Use `git diff` to verify changes, then prepare a commit message for approval.
- [ ] Update the "Journal" section below with the current state.
- [ ] Wait for approval before committing and proceeding.

### Phase 2: Porting and Refactoring the Application Logic

- [ ] Copy the `lib/main.dart` from `examples/simple_chat` to `packages/genui_client/example/lib/main.dart`.
- [ ] Remove the `firebase_core` import and `Firebase.initializeApp()` call.
- [ ] Replace the `flutter_genui` import with `package:genui_client/genui_client.dart`.
- [ ] In `_ChatScreenState`, replace the `flutter_genui` `UiAgent` with the `genui_client` `UiAgent`.
- [ ] Implement an `_init()` method in `_ChatScreenState` to call `_uiAgent.startSession()`.
- [ ] Remove the `_messages` list and `_onSurfaceAdded` callback.
- [ ] Replace the main `Column` in the `build` method with the `GenUiChat` widget.
- [ ] Remove the `MessageController` and `MessageView` classes (and the `message.dart` file).
- [ ] Update the `_sendMessage` method to use the new `_uiAgent.sendRequest`.

**Post-Phase 2 Steps:**

- [ ] Run `dart_fix` and `dart_format` to clean up the ported Dart code.
- [ ] Run `analyze_files` and fix any reported issues.
- [ ] Run tests to ensure all pass.
- [ ] Run `dart_format` again to ensure correct formatting.
- [ ] Use `git diff` to verify changes, then prepare a commit message for approval.
- [ ] Update the "Journal" section below with the current state.
- [ ] Wait for approval before committing and proceeding.

### Phase 3: Finalization and Documentation

- [ ] Ensure the `README.md` is comprehensive and accurate.
- [ ] Run the example to verify it works as expected with a local `genui_server`.
- [ ] Delete the now-unused `lib/message.dart` file.

**Post-Phase 3 Steps:**

- [ ] Run `dart_fix` and `dart_format` on any modified files.
- [ ] Run `analyze_files` and fix any reported issues.
- [ ] Run tests to ensure all pass.
- [ ] Run `dart_format` again to ensure correct formatting.
- [ ] Use `git diff` to verify changes, then prepare a commit message for approval.
- [ ] Update the "Journal" section below with the final state.
- [ ] Wait for approval before committing.
